# Continuous Integration

## 1. Job dependencies

I've set up job dependencies to run some of them (e.g. Snyk checks)
only if necessary ones (test, lint) pass.
Also, no need to push image to Docker Hub if tests do not pass.

## 2. Fixed Actions versions

I've set up fixed versions of Actions and Go
to make pipeline more stable in the future.

## 3. Run on demand

Jobs for Go application will run only if Go app
source code updated or the workflow itself.

## 4. Caching

I'm using Go dependencies caching relying on `go.sum` to speed up repeated workflow execution.
The same is applied to Docker build action.

## 5. GitHub secrets

I do not reveal any secret tokens in source code or workflow because
I have inherited them in GitHub Actions settings.

## 6. Snyk vulnerabilities check

I use Snyk action to check vulnerabilities in my code
and its dependencies.
