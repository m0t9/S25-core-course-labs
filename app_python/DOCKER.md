# Docker image building

I've built a Docker image for Python application and successfully pushed it to Docker Hub.
The image can be seen [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/m0t9docker/pyapp/general).

## Best Practices applied

### Dockerfile linting

`hadolint` linter was used to readability and style in application Dockerfile.

### Minimal base image

I've used Python `alpine`-based image with minimal size to enhance building speed, decrease final image size as well as number of vulnerabilities.

### Pinned base image version

I've pinned Python Alpine base image to `3.10` version.
This allows me always use this Python version.
Image will be safe in case of any bugs in newer Python releases.

### Non-root user

In Dockerfile I've created a usergroup with user with limited permissions (in comparison with `root`) to decrease security risks.

### Optimized layering

The operations in the Dockerfile are sorted in ascending order of update rate
 (e.g., `requirements.txt` is less frequently updating file than `main.py` with source code).

 This allows effective reuse of the cache from the previous layers.

### Dockerignore

`.dockerignore` file allows ignoring files from the build context, increasing
efficiency of image build process.
