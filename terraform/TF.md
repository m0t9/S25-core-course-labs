# Terraform

## Best practices

1. I do not share any tokens or other private variables values because
of using ignored files with envs.

2. For the Terraform I configured `.gitignore` file

3. Before running, I use `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` to check configuration.

## Docker

### `terraform state list`

```bash
╰─➤  terraform state list                                                                                                                                 1 ↵
docker_container.moscow_time_app
docker_container.number_facts_app
```

### `terraform state show`

For Python application

```bash
``╰─➤  terraform state show docker_container.moscow_time_app
